You need these R packages for this toolbox:

via R:
install.packages("gridExtra","reshape2","ggplot2","plotrix",'tcl', 'argparse')



or via debian packages:
sudo apt-get install r-cran-reshape2 r-cran-ggplot2 r-cran-plotrix
unfortunately grid extra isnt in the debian repos(for wheezy):
in R: install.packages('gridExtra')

You need to source source_reminder for the tools to be in your path.

Use the template from /Rscript/Template.R to add a script. It contains the full indications for interfacing your R scripts with the surrounding tools.
